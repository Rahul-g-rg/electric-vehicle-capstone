## üìå Project Overview

This capstone project uses machine learning to classify electric vehicles (EVs) into two major types:
- **BEV**: Battery Electric Vehicle  
- **PHEV**: Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle

The project utilizes Washington State's EV Population dataset to analyze and predict EV adoption patterns.

---

## üéØ Objective

To develop a classification model that can accurately identify the type of EV based on features like:
- Model Year
- Make
- Electric Range
- Base MSRP
- CAFV Eligibility

---

## üß∞ Tools & Technologies

- **Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, scikit-learn, joblib
- **Environment**: Jupyter Notebook

---

## üîç Project Workflow

1. **Data Cleaning**
   - Removed missing values and duplicates
   - Handled outliers using IQR

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualized distribution of model year, range, MSRP, and make

3. **Feature Engineering**
   - Label encoding and One-Hot encoding
   - Removed high-cardinality columns

4. **Modeling**
   - Trained Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting models
   - Evaluated using Accuracy, F1 Score, and ROC-AUC

5. **Model Deployment**
   - Saved best model using `joblib`

## üß† Key Insights

- Tesla dominates EV registrations in Washington
- BEVs are more common than PHEVs
- Significant EV adoption occurred post-2018
